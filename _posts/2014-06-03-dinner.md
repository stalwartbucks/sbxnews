Come to the second ever Stalwartbucks dinner (sorry for the delay).

On Monday, June 9 at 7 PM, Joe Weisenthal and Guan Yang will host the second ever Stalwartbucks dinner at one of NYC’s finest Korean Barbecue establishments. There we will discuss the latest in tech, economics, digital currencies, Korean Barbecue, and anything else that strikes people’s fancy. It will be a very enjoyable evening.

Want to attend and have a stimulating night with some of NYC’s most interesting people? All you have to is spend 1,000,000 (B) SBX on a seat. These funds will go into a pot and be disbursed over time to future users of the currency, so that adoption will grow.

Upon your purchase of a ticket, you will be told the location of the restaurant.

Important note: This just buys you access to the dinner. (The actual food, unfortunately, we have to pay for in real USD. For now.)

Any questions? Email Joe (jnathan@gmail.com) or Guan (guan@yang.dk)

We look forward to seeing you there!
