Come to the eigth Stalwartbucks dinner and the first of 2016.

On Tuesday, January 5 at 7 PM, Joe Weisenthal and Guan Yang will host the seventh ever (we think) Stalwartbucks dinner at one of NYC’s finest barbecue establishments. There we will discuss the latest in tech, economics, digital currencies, Korean and American Barbecue, and anything else that strikes people’s fancy. It will be a very enjoyable evening.

Want to attend and have a stimulating night with some of NYC’s most interesting people? All you have to is spend 1,000,000 (B) SBX on a seat. These funds will go into a pot and be disbursed over time to future users of the currency, so that adoption will grow.

Important note: This just buys you access to the dinner. (The actual food, unfortunately, we have to pay for in real USD. For now.)

Any questions? Email Joe (jnathan@gmail.com) or Guan (guan@yang.dk)

We look forward to seeing you there! We will email you a confirmation with a payment address. Don’t have enough SBX? Don’t worry too much—you can most likely buy or barter some from another participant at the dinner. You must be willing to set up a Stalwartbucks wallet.
